# ValueBot

*A Slack bot for calling out coworkers for espousing your organization's values.*

## Usage

A call-out is a message that includes a username and a hashtag representing a value to call the user out for. You provide the list of hashtags to listen to in the [config file](#config). For example, if I wanted to call out `@mary` for an innovative solution to a problem that's been bugging the team for a while, that message would look like:

`@mary helped us all out with that #innovative solution`
